    "Now that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the labyrinth of hallways and office furniture that makes up this part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be a graphic design department; the walls are covered in specifications for triangles.\n",

    "The design document gives the side lengths of each triangle it describes, but... `5 10 25`? Some of these aren't triangles. You can't help but mark the impossible ones.\n",

    "In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side. For example, the \"triangle\" given above is impossible, because `5` + `10` is not larger than `25`.\n",
