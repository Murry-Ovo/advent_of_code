    "# --- Day 3: Squares With Three Sides ---\n",
    "Now that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the labyrinth of hallways and office furniture that makes up this part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be a graphic design department; the walls are covered in specifications for triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "The design document gives the side lengths of each triangle it describes, but... `5 10 25`? Some of these aren't triangles. You can't help but mark the impossible ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side. For example, the \"triangle\" given above is impossible, because `5` + `10` is not larger than `25`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part One\n",
    "In your puzzle input, how many of the listed triangles are possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part Two\n",
    "Now that you've helpfully marked up their design documents, it occurs to you that triangles are specified in groups of three vertically. Each set of three numbers in a column specifies a triangle. Rows are unrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the following specification, numbers with the same hundreds digit would be part of the same triangle:\n",
    "```\n",
    "101 301 501\n",
    "102 302 502\n",
    "103 303 503\n",

    "203 403 603\n",
    "``` \n",
    "In your puzzle input, and instead reading by columns, how many of the listed triangles are possible?"
